<h1>TinyWiki</h1><br>
is a tiny wiki where all editing is done with html code.<br>
The included editor will give a lot of help with the basic coding and with creating internal links to new topics.<h2>Internal links</h2> 
To create an internal link to an new or existing topic, just mark the section of text you want to include, click the &lt;a&gt; button and you got a ready to go link.<br>
if The link goes to a none existing topic it will look like <a href="/?id=A_Topic_not_very_likely_to_exist">A Topic not very likely to exist</a> While <a href="/?id=TinyWiki">TinyWiki</a> is an existing visited topic;
<br>
Now you can also use and edit .js and .css files, edit them as ordinary wiki files and link them with path like /file.js
check out <a href="/?id=my.css">my.css</a>
<style src="my.css"></style>
<div class="redtest">Red</div>

<br><br>
Wish you much fun with TinyWiki<br>
